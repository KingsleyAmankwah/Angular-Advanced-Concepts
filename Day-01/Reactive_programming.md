# Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on data streams and propagation of change. It's a way to structure programs that are event-driven, resilient, and responsive.

## Key concepts

- <b>Data streams</b>: Data is treated as a continuous flow of events or values over time, rather than static values.
- <b> Observables</b>: Objects that represent these streams of data. They emit values over time, and observers can subscribe to them to receive those values.
- <b>Operators</b>: Functions that transform, filter, combine, or otherwise manipulate data streams, creating new streams.
- <b>Non-blocking </b>: Reactive programs don't block while waiting for events or data. They can continue processing other tasks, making them efficient and scalable.
- <b> Declarative </b>: Reactive programs often use a declarative style, where you specify what you want to happen (the desired outcome), rather than how to make it happen (the imperative steps).
