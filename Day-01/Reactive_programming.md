# Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on data streams and propagation of change. It's a way to structure programs that are event-driven, resilient, and responsive.

## Key concepts

- <b>Data streams </b>: Data is treated as a continuous flow of events or values over time, rather than static values.
- Observables: Objects that represent these streams of data. They emit values over time, and observers can subscribe to them to receive those values.
- Operators: Functions that transform, filter, combine, or otherwise manipulate data streams, creating new streams.
- Non-blocking: Reactive programs don't block while waiting for events or data. They can continue processing other tasks, making them efficient and scalable.
- Declarative: Reactive programs often use a declarative style, where you specify what you want to happen (the desired outcome), rather than how to make it happen (the imperative steps).
