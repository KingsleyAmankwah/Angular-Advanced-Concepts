# Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on data streams and propagation of change. It's a way to structure programs that are event-driven, resilient, and responsive.

## Key concepts

- #### Data streams

  Data streams can represent anything from user input, server responses. It is treated as a continuous flow of events or values over time, rather than static values.

- #### Observables

  You can say that Observables represent responses from events. Observables are essentially streams of data that can emit values over time. When an event occurs, an Observable can emit a response associated with that event, and observers can subscribe to the Observable to receive these responses. This makes Observables particularly useful in handling asynchronous or time-based event data, such as user input, HTTP requests, or any other type of event that might produce data over time..

- #### Operators

  Operators are functions that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner. Using the map and filter operators, you can transform the data received from the endpoint before it's handled by the subscriber.

- #### Non-blocking

  Reactive programs don't block while waiting for events or data. They can continue processing other tasks, making them efficient and scalable.

- #### Declarative
  Reactive programs often use a declarative style, where you specify what you want to happen (the desired outcome), rather than how to make it happen (the imperative steps).

## Common use cases

- Handling asynchronous operations like user interactions, network requests, or file I/O.
- Building real-time applications like chat apps, dashboards, or games.
- Managing state in large applications.
- Creating resilient and scalable systems.

## Popular reactive programming libraries

- RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript): A library for reactive programming in JavaScript.
- Reactor (Java): A reactive library for building non-blocking applications on the JVM.
- Akka Streams (Scala/Java): A library for constructing stream-processing pipelines.
- Project Reactor (Java): A foundation for reactive programming on the JVM.
- RxJava (Java): A Java implementation of ReactiveX.
- RxSwift (Swift): A reactive programming library for iOS and macOS.

## Conclusion

Reactive programming is a powerful paradigm that can help you write more responsive, resilient, and scalable applications. It's increasingly popular in modern web development, mobile development, and server-side programming.
